Overview
========

I'm rewriting the parser - now using RE2C and Lemon (rather than flex/bison previously discussed).

The principle aim behind this, more than a thousand lines of Python output rewrite - blocked.  I 
need the parser to do more work.

Features:
LEXER P1: Comments are stripped (in theory, these could be passed to e.g. an Express text editor)
LEXER P2: Named scopes are resolved
LEXER P3: Tokens are returned, and Anonymous scopes added
PARSER: Single pass.

Tests: 
  * test/unitary_schemas (ok, 2 expected failures)
  * data/*/*.exp (ok, no failures)
  
Generally, I believe there should be a more feature complete test set: Fully automated checking of 
parse trees.  Although I don't fully understand how this should be achieved yet.

Next steps:
  1. Refactor to improve lexer actions
  2. Integrate parser
  3. General error handling strategy (to be discussed)

Requirements
============

RE2C - versions before 1.0 have significant bugs, I used 1.0.3 - not the version in BRL-CAD.
Lemon - I would guess any recent version would work (I haven't tested yet).

building

$ re2c -W -Wno-match-empty-string -r -c --tags -t expscan.h -o expscan.c expscan.l
$ lemon -p -c expparser.y 

compile bstrlib.o, lexsupport.o and the above outputs

a main is defined in expparser.y for the moment.

./test some/express/file.exp
